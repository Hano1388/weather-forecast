# Weather-Forecast

### Getting Started

download or clone the repo and run the following commands in your terminal or cmd
```
> cd weather-forecast
> npm install
> npm start
```

### My Challenges
 1. send all ajax requests through redux
 2. Drawing a line chart(using a react component that has already built by another developer and figuring out how to integrate it into the project)
 3. How to deal with a redux application where our state changes significantly overtime
